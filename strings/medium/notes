                                                   =>STRING BUILDER<=
 stringbuilder is a class in java.lang package used to create and manipulate mutable sequences of 
 characters.
 >need?= while using string class which is immutable and creates a new object for every modification
 stringbuilder modifies its internal character array in place, making it faster and more memory
 efficient for string operations.
 >characteristics?= it is mutable without creating new objects, not thread safe like stringbuffer
 >working?= stringbuilder maintains a char[] array to store characters. it has a capacity and length
 but if you append more characters than the current capacity then it automatically resizes the array.
