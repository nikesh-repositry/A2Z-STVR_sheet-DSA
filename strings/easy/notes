==============================================STRINGS
>definition-
 string is a sequence of characters and in java it is represented by the String class from the 
 java.lang package which is imported automatically. java uses unicode UTF-16 for characters.
 =strings are IMMUTABLE means that once it is created then that value can not be changed and this
 immutability ensures thread safety and enables optimizations like string pooling.
